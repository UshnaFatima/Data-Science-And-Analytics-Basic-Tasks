                                  Text Emotion Analysis Project 

This project reads text from a file, cleans it, removes stop words, and identifies emotions using a predefined list. Finally, it displays the emotions on a bar graph.

✅ Step 1 — Imported Required Libraries

string → to remove punctuation

Counter (collections) → to count repeated emotions

matplotlib → to plot the emotion chart

✅ Step 2 — Read the Input Text

We opened the text file
read.txt
and read all of its content into a variable.

✅ Step 3 — Cleaned the Text

To prepare the text for analysis, we did:

converted the text into lowercase

removed punctuation

split the text into individual words

✅ Step 4 — Removed Stop Words

We defined a list of common words such as
I, you, as, the, is, are, etc.
These add no meaning to emotional understanding.

We removed all stop words to keep only meaningful words.

✅ Step 5 — Emotion Detection

We used another file called emotion.txt
which contains word-to-emotion mappings in the form:

happy: joy
angry: anger
sad: sadness


Steps done:

Read every line from emotion.txt

Split it into word and emotion

Check if the word exists in our filtered word list

If yes, add the emotion to a list

✅ Step 6 — Count the Emotions

We used Counter to count how many times each emotion appears.
Example output might look like:

{'joy': 3, 'sadness': 1, 'anger': 2}

✅ Step 7 — Visualized the Emotion Counts

We drew a bar graph showing the frequency of each emotion.
This helps easily see which emotion dominates the text.

🎯 Final Output

The script identifies the emotional tone of a document

Shows the detected emotions and their counts

Displays a bar chart of emotions for visualization
