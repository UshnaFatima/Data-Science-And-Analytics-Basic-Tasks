                              Task: Bank Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis


Project Overview
Customer churn (attrition) is one of the most significant issues facing the banking industry today. It costs much more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. 

This project aims to build a high-performing classification model to identify "at-risk" customers. By leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, we not only predict who will leave but also identify the specific behaviors and demographics that lead to churn.



Data Dictionary
The dataset consists of 10,000 customers 


Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection: Dropped `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, and `Surname` as they are unique identifiers with no predictive power.
- Handling Categorical Data: Applied  Label Encoding  to Gender (Binary).
- Applied  One-Hot Encoding  to Geography to prevent the model from assuming a mathematical order between countries.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During analysis, we observed that:
- Churn rates are significantly higher in  Germany  compared to France and Spain.
- Older customers (40-60 age bracket) show a higher tendency to exit.
- Customers with  3 or more products  have an extremely high churn rate, suggesting potential dissatisfaction with complex product bundles.


3. Machine Learning Pipeline
-  Algorithm:  Random Forest Classifier (100 Decision Trees).
-  Data Splitting:  80% Train / 20% Test.
-  Stratification:  Used to ensure the minority class (churners) is equally represented in both sets.


Model Performance
The model achieved an  Accuracy of 86.1% .

Metric               | Score 
Precision (Class 1)  | 0.77 (High confidence when predicting churn) 
Recall (Class 1)     | 0.45 (Ability to find all churners)
F1-Score             | 0.57 


Business Insights & Recommendations
Based on the  Feature Importance  analysis, here are the strategic recommendations for the bank:

1.  Targeted Retention for Seniors:  Since  Age  is the top driver, the bank should design loyalty programs or specialized investment products for customers aged 45+.
2.  Review Multi-Product Strategy:  Customers with many products are leaving. The bank should investigate if these customers are being over-charged or if the products are too difficult to manage together.
3.  Regional Focus (Germany):  German customers churn at a higher rate. A localized survey is recommended to check if competitors in that region offer better interest rates.
4.  Engagement Programs:  "Active Members" are much less likely to leave. Encouraging app usage and frequent transactions can reduce churn.
