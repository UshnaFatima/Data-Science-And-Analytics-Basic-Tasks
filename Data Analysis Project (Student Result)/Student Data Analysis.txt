                                    Project Overview 
                                Student Result Data Analysis

In this project, we analyzed student marks using simple Python steps.
Here is what we did:

✅ Step 1 — Imported Libraries

We used three important libraries:

pandas → to load and handle data

matplotlib → to create visual graphs

seaborn → to make colorful and better-looking charts

✅ Step 2 — Loaded the Dataset

We read the file "Student Data.csv" from the computer
and stored it in a DataFrame for analysis.

✅ Step 3 — Explored the Dataset

We:

Displayed the first five rows

Checked the column names and data types
This helped us understand what the dataset contains.

✅ Step 4 — Performed Data Analysis

We ignored the Name column and analyzed the numeric subject marks.

Calculated the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for each student
👉 CV = standard deviation ÷ mean
This tells us how consistent a student’s performance is.

Added the CV as a new column in the DataFrame

Found the best student
👉 The one with the lowest CV
(which means their performance is the most stable across subjects)

✅ Step 5 — Created a Visualization

We reshaped the data and created a bar chart showing:

Each student’s score in every subject

Different colors for different subjects

A legend to identify subjects

This graph helps us easily compare student performance.

🎯 Final Outcome

Loaded, explored, analyzed, and visualized student marks

Identified the most consistent performer

Made the results easy to understand using a plot
