                              Task: Credit Risk Prediction


1. OBJECTIVE
------------
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan. This binary classification task helps financial institutions assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

2. DATASET
----------
* Source File: loan_dataset_20000.csv
* Description: The dataset contains 20,000 records of loan applicants.
* Key Features:
  - Numerical: Annual Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Debt-to-Income Ratio, etc.
  - Categorical: Education Level, Employment Status, Loan Purpose, Grade, etc.
* Target Variable: 'loan_paid_back' (1 = Paid Back/Non-Default, 0 = Default)

3. METHODOLOGY
--------------
The project was executed in the following stages:

A. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualized the distribution of Loan Amounts and Annual Income.
   - Analyzed the count of applicants based on Education Level.
   - Examined the balance of the Target Variable (Loan Repayment Status).

B. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling Missing Values:
     * Numerical columns imputed with the 'median'.
     * Categorical columns imputed with the 'most frequent' value.
   - Feature Engineering:
     * Numerical features were standardized using StandardScaler.
     * Categorical features were transformed using OneHotEncoder.
   - Train-Test Split: Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

C. Model Training
   - Algorithm: Logistic Regression
   - Setup: Implemented via a Scikit-Learn Pipeline combining preprocessing 
     and the classifier to prevent data leakage and streamline predictions.

4. MODEL EVALUATION & RESULTS
-----------------------------
The Logistic Regression model was evaluated on the test set.

* Accuracy: 88.05%

* Confusion Matrix:
  ---------------------------------
  |                 | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
  |-----------------|-------------|-------------|
  | Actual 0 (Def)  |     461     |     357     |
  | Actual 1 (Paid) |     121     |    3061     |
  ---------------------------------

* Classification Report Summary:
  - The model performs exceptionally well on the majority class (Paid Back) 
    with a recall of 0.96.
  - Identification of defaults (Class 0) has a precision of 0.79 and recall 
    of 0.56, which is typical for imbalanced credit datasets but effectively 
    filters out high-risk candidates.
